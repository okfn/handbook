=======================================
Welcome to the Data Wrangling Handbook!
=======================================

The Data Wrangling Handbook is a companion text to the `School of Data`_. Its
function is something like a traditional textbook - it will provide the detail
and background theory to support the School of Data courses and challenges.

The Data Wrangling Handbook is currently in an early stage of development. Over
the coming months we intend to write more chapters and flesh out this skeleton
with content and detail. We also hope to expand and improve upon this basic
outline, so if there's a section that you currently feel is missing, please do
let us know!

The Data Wrangling Handbook is a collaborative endeavour, and we welcome all
feedback and contributions. To contribute to the Data Wrangling Handbook you
can:

* Edit directly on the `Data Wrangling Github Repository`_
* Submit an issue to our `issue tracker`_
* Write a new contribution - you can do this in the format and editor of your choice (Google Docs, Open Office, Word, Latex ...) and then email it to schoolofdata [@] okfn.org
* Email us ideas and suggestions at schoolofdata [@] okfn.org 
* Send tweets to `@SchoolOfData`_

The Data Wrangling Handbook should be accessible to all learners. It comes
with a :doc:`appendix/glossary` explaining the important terms and concepts. If you
stumble across an unexplained term or a concept that requires more explanation,
please do get in touch.
